#### Project Overview

Zenith is a fintech app that tracks your expenses and helps to plan your budget.

#### Features

- **Goal Visualisation:** Interactive charts and graphs help users track their progress toward their financial aspirations, offering a clear path to achieving their dreams.
- **Expense Tracking:** The app categorises spending habits and identifies opportunities to cut costs, helping users build effective budgeting habits.
- **Notifications and Reminders:** Personalised reminders and guidance ensure that users stay on track with their financial plans, preventing missed opportunities.
- **AI - Chatbot:** Follow the path of increasing resistance in a path to combat impulse and irresponsible spending by allowing users to quickly interact with our bot to know whether their impulse to buy something is a cost they can bear with their current plan or they should skip it.
- **Gamification:** To make the process enjoyable and motivating, we've gamified financial planning, offering rewards and milestones for financial achievements.

#### Use Cases

Young individuals, navigating the transition into adulthood, often find themselves ill-equipped to manage their finances effectively. The complexities of student loans, cost-sharing with friends, accumulating debts, and balancing daily expenses can lead to financial stress and missed opportunities.

#### Key Functionalities

At its core, this app is dedicated to empowering everyday financial confidence for individuals of all backgrounds. Our vision is to create an accessible and actionable platform that simplifies financial planning, making it attainable and enjoyable for everyone, whether they are starting their financial journey or planning for the future.
