#### **Project Overview**

Understanding complex data structures is a significant challenge in computer science education. To address this, we developed the **Interactive Data Structure Visualizer**, a web-based platform that simplifies learning through real-time, Python-centric visualizations.

This innovative tool bridges the gap between theoretical concepts and practical understanding by offering dynamic visual aids, step-by-step execution tracing, and secure, containerized code execution. It's designed for students, educators, and self-learners, fostering intuitive and hands-on exploration of data structures.

#### **Features**

- **Real-Time Visualization**  
  Observe live transformations in data structures during code execution.
- **Interactive Debugging**  
  Step through operations like insertion, deletion, and searching to track variable changes.
- **Browser-Based and Platform-Independent**  
  Accessible on any device without installations.
- **Secure Code Execution**  
  Sandboxed environments ensure security for multi-user functionality.
- **Educational Enhancements**  
  Includes intuitive error handling and conceptual explanations for each data structure.

#### **Use Cases**

1. **For Students**  
   Visualize operations on data structures to grasp concepts effectively.
2. **For Educators**  
   Demonstrate real-time transformations in classroom environments.
3. **For Developers**  
   Debug and analyze code behavior intuitively.

#### **System Architecture**

The application follows a modular architecture:

- **Frontend:**
  Interactive UI with visualization components.
- **Code Preprocessor:**
  Manages code parsing and preparation for execution.
- **Code Executor:**
  Handles code execution requests and returns results after safe execution within isolated environments.
- **Visualization Engine:**
  Renders real-time visualizations based on execution data.

#### **Key Functionalities**

- **Code Input and Execution**  
  Submit Python code snippets and observe their execution.
- **Visualization**  
  Displays step-by-step transformations in data structures like arrays, trees, and graphs.
- **Error Handling**  
  Detects and highlights errors with detailed feedback.
- **Integration**  
  Easily embeddable in Learning Management Systems (LMS) or educational platforms.
